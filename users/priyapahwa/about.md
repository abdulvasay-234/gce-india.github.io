Priya Pahwa is pursuing a Bachelor of Technology with a major in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Hamirpur or NITH located in the dense pine forests and low-lying hills of Himachal Pradesh state in India. 

Having a keen interest in web development, she has a sound knowledge of Django Web and Django REST Frameworks. What keeps her heart awake is a colorful silence while engaging in the fine details of sketching and painting, the music of visuals, and the harmony with thoughts.
 
A firm believer in knowledge and experiences being the commodities to share, she has been a part of the core technical community of her institute since her freshman year. From her standpoint, a diverse community welcomes a variety of perspectives, those perspectives spark collaboration, collaboration fuels change, and embracing change fires the path to innovation.
