ðŸ‘‹ I am a high school student from Mumbai, India and an incoming student at the University of Toronto.
I love working with Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision and Kubernetes but by night you will also find me working with Android.

I am an active contributor to multiple open-source projects in the attempt to do my bit for the community.
I also love building open-source projects some of which were also socially impactful (usually related to Machine Learning) and some of which have also been #1 trending on GitHub.
Seeing my work at a rather young age, I was invited to speak at 2 TEDx and 1 TED-Ed events. I also love hackathons and community and I have represented my country in multiple international hackathons and won a few too, I am also a Linux Foundation Dan Kohn Scholar.
Most of the time you will find me working on new Math or Machine Learning research ideas and I have a couple of published papers as well.

## Random Stuff

I also play Valorant, GTA 5, Apex Legends (a bit) and CS: GO, feel free to [play with me](https://www.rishit.tech/gaming).
